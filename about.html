          <h3>Short bio</h3>
          <p>
            I am a graduate student in Computer Science at the University of Florida, focusing on 
            Human-Centered Computing and Virtual Reality. My research interests include VR interaction 
            design, cybersickness, multisensory perception, and human–AI interaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before UF, I completed my B.Tech. in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on 
            Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, where I worked on EEG-based motor imagery 
            classification and other applied machine learning projects.

          <p>
            I am particularly interested in how small changes in motion, visuals, and feedback can 
            dramatically alter how comfortable and natural VR feels. My long-term goal is to develop 
            VR interaction and locomotion techniques that enable longer, safer, and more accessible use 
            of immersive systems.

          <h2 class="section-title">Long-term goals</h2>
          <p>
            I plan to pursue a Ph.D. in Computer Science with a specialization in VR and HCI, and 
            ultimately work as a researcher and educator. I am excited about building tools, 
            experimental platforms, and collaborative projects that help us better understand how 
            people interact with immersive technologies.
